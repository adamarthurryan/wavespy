Wave Spy allows the user to listen to ambient electromagnetic (EM) waves and to explore the EM emissions of electronic devices.

Wave Spy was produced for a sound art show at Interstices art space in Griffintown, Montreal. The piece falls under the ruberic of ‘device art’ – it is presented as a self-contained consumer product, complete with logo and instruction manual.

The Wave Spy is suited to exploration in detail. With the Wave Spy, for example, we can hear not only the total noise produced by a laptop computer, but can actually interrogate its parts in detail – we can isolate the steady buzz of the back light dimmer, the variable tone of the optical drive, the intense white noise from the CPU etc.
